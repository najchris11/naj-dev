            Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with experience working on innovative web
            projects, from designing accessible websites to building modern applications.
            Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my education at <strong>Ohio State University</strong>, where Iâ€™m
            actively involved in the <strong>National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My recent work includes a <strong>Next.js CMS project</strong> designed to simplify content
            management, a portfolio site for <strong>M.C. Jeter</strong>, and a revamp of the
            <strong>mcjeterbooks</strong> website. During my internship at <strong>JP Morgan Chase</strong>, I
            developed a new React frontend for an internal tool used by thousands of
            legal entities, collaborating with international teams and UX designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My commitment to accessible and user-friendly designs is evident in the work
            Iâ€™ve done modernizing outdated systems and supporting organizations to better
            manage their content through tools like <strong>Umbraco</strong>.
